# empirical-industrial-organization

Sharing code related to Empirical Industrial Organization, which is (currently) the research focus of my PhD in Economics at Insper.

Most of the code here was obtained and/or adapted from other public pages on the web. My goal is to reproduce key concepts of Empirical IO and its applications in a comprehensive way. I'm a hands-on person, so feel free to colaborate if you're like that too!

I write to learn! If you find anything wrong/inconsistent, please let me know! My e-mail address is heitoraol@al.insper.edu.br. Thanks!
